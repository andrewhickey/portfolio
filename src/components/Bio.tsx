    <p>
      I work with my clients to build products from the ground up or iterate on
      an existing design. I am comfortable in both leadership and senior
      engineer positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've used TDD and a variety of languages to build
      <Link to="/portfolio">award winning sites</Link> for clients in domains
      from e-learning to fin-tech. In recent projects I have used React, React
      Native and Node.js to solve some data heavy problems in a user friendly
      fashion. Outside of work I can be found in Newbury UK, either cooking or
      coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have something that needs building then I'd love to hear about it.
